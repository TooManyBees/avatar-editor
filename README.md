## todo

* buttons to remove items from collections
* room doors should be keyed by direction, not a list
* do apply flags allow pipe-separated bits on the immunity type?? apply special parsing if so
* make sure that new items are added to the same end of the list that the add item button is on
* properly handle boolean applies (flying, sanc, etc) that don't need values
